# small-webapp-ggl

A small website showcasing a lash technician business, using HTML and CSS.
A big goal for this project was to make the website responsive, and looking good on mobile.
Initially I wanted to add hover animations for pricing and other things but chose against it
as most would not be mobile friendly.

I decided to place the booking on the home page to minimize bloat. The call to action button takes the user straight to the "Booking Enquiry" portion of the page. I made sure to include 3 cards including the services offered, with their pricing as this is the main information users will look for.

This is my first ever HTML/CSS build, so forgive me if its a little rough on the edges.
